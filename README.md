Jupyter Notebook file can be found in the file titled pymaceuticals 

 Collaboration with other students- I worked with Nicholas Fussy and Hunter Becker when it came to comparing results of code along with sharing portions of code to help complete the project. This helped us brainstorm and help each other with issues we ran into while working with this code. 

I had a couple brainstorming sessions on where to start the assignment.   
Students I had discussions with on this project- Nicholas Fussy, and Hunter Becker. 

I also took code from a variety of our in class examples to help create the code I had used in my project.

When it came to debugging my code of errors to ensure that it ran smoothly, I used Microsoft Copilot to help clear errors that I encountered.  This helped with any formatting issues I had when it came to completing this assignment.  


Analysis- While examining the mouse data a variety of different drugs were used in the test.  It seems that the drug regimen that had the largest mean tumor volume was Ketapril with 55.23 and the smallest was with Ramicane with a mean tumor volume of 40.21.  Also, in terms of the amount of timepoints that were observed Capomulin had the most while Propiva had the least amount of observed timepoints.  When looking at the genders of mice used in this study there was slightly more male mice than females with males having 50.4 percent and females having 49.6 percent of the total population.  Lastly when examining the average tumor volume compared to the weight of the mice in grams it seems the tumors average volume increased by 0.84 per gram of increased weight.
